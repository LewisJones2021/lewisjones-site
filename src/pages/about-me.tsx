    I am a junior developer who's mostly focused on the front-end, where I've self-taught to break into the software realm. 
    My learning journey has been a mix of watching YouTube tutorials, taking popular online coding courses, and doing my fair share of googling! 
    I've been playing around with HTML and CSS for a few years now, and recently, I've ventured into JavaScript to understand the basics of working with APIs and fetching data. 
    I'm also enjoying crafting interactive web applications and learning along the way.

    <p className="text-black md:text-xl mt-5 md:leading-6">
    The spark for my interest in coding comes from my family and friends, who are talented and passionate software engineers.
    I've always been intrigued by the mechanics of clicking buttons and generating data on websites, and now I find joy in writing my own code. 
    Exploring the inner workings of the World Wide Web is truly fascinating.
